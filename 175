China, Pakistan launch joint air drill  



BEIJING: Shaheen (Eagle)-4, a joint drill between the air forces of China and Pakistan, began on Sunday in China, a military spokesman announced. The Chinese contingent includes fighter jets, fighter bombers and early warning planes while its Pakistani counterpart dispatched fighter jets and early warning planes, the spokesman said. He, however, did not say how long the drill would last. He said the joint exercise is part of a series of military exchange programmes between the two air forces, adding that China’s Air Force was willing to expand the scope of cooperation with various countries. The first such drill was held in Pakistan in March 2011, the second in China’s western Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in September 2013, and the third was held in Pakistan, in May last year.  QUETTA/LAHORE/PESHAWAR: Torrential rains accompanied by flash floods have killed at least 20 people ...
