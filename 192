Revolution and its sizzling Economic Revolution. But you haven\'t heard about its other great social upheaval - the Chinese Sexual Revolution - and like everything in that country it\'s happening at warp speed. It\'s China\'s version of the 60s revolution - on steroids. China\'s Sexual Revolution is the world\'s first glimpse - often using secret cameras - into this forbidden new China. It\'s a surprising portrait of the Chinese today: the new free love generation that\'s left their parents in shock; the booming sex industry that\'s creating an HIV crisis; the new generation of career women and feminists that suddenly wants it all - while millions of men feel left out. This long untold story goes back to the days of Chairman Mao, who made sexuality a great taboo. He ordered everyone to wear unisexual Mao suits, and forbid women from wearing sexy clothing, getting stylish haircuts, or even wearing make-up. Men and women were expected to be comrades - not lovers - though Mao himself enjoyed an emperor\'s sex life, seeking virgins to retain his \"youthö\". China\'s sexual libido was bottled up for 50 years, but now its bursting loose, with dramatic effects on marriage, personal freedom and the government itself....

SOUTH CHINA SEA — The South China Sea has been a source of much tension among countries with competing territorial claims to portions of the region, and China\'s rapid expansion in recent years has only made things worse. According to the Washington Post, about a third of the world\'s shipping lines pass through the South China Sea annually. The area is abundant with oil, natural gas, marine life and other resources — and no less than six countries are claiming land there as their own. Invoking geographical proximity, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim all or part of the disputed islands in the area. China claims the entire South China Sea as its territory. In 2014, its nine-dash line was updated to a 10-dash-line, now including Taiwan. According to a report compiled for the U.S. Congress, China began dredging in the South China Sea in 2013, moving sediment from the seafloor to submerged reefs to create artificial islands. By 2015, there were seven new islets: Mischief, Subi, Fiery Cross, Gaven, Hughs, Cuarteron, and Johnson South Reefs. Shortly afterwards, China built docks, lighthouses, bunkers, helipads, communication towers and other infrastructure on the islands. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reports that in September 2015, a three-kilometer runway was completed on Fiery Cross Reef, with three civilian test flights successfully landing by January. Airstrips are nearing completion at both Subi and Mischief Reefs. Radar facilities on the smaller islets — Cuarteron, Gaven, Hughs and Johnson South — allow China to monitor surfa...

China (i/ˈtʃaɪnə/; Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; see also Names of China), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is the world's most-populous country, with a population of over 1.3 billion. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometres, the East Asian state is the world's second-largest country by land area, and the third- or fourth-largest in total area, depending on the definition of total area. The People's Republic of China is a single-party state governed by the Communist Party of China. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four directly controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). Its capital city is Beijing. The PRC also claims Taiwan—which is controlled by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity—as its 23rd province, a claim controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil War. The PRC government denies the legitimacy of the ROC.
